TODO(REVIEW):
- As with `AuthenticatedDictionary`, the same `Λ` question; please cf. Definition 3 TODO(REVIEW)
  in https://github.com/NethermindEth/FVIntmax/pull/2.
- The 'randomness' is currently modelled trivially (cf. `Wheels/Wheels.lean`).
  Does it seem sensible? Do we need anything better than that? Actually, we could probably
  even get away with less?

  Definition 6

  TODO(WARN): This definition is subject to change specifically to replace `List.unzip/unzip` with
              `List.map Prod.fst/snd`, we will see what lemmas there are in mathlib, but the idea
              for the time being is that the relationship between `kₚ` and `kₛ` is more explicit
              if `unzip` and `zip` are used.

  Definition 7

  TODO(REVIEW): It is unclear to me from the definition as to where the secret key should come from
                for the: > 'belongs to an honest user who didn’t sign the message m with their secret key',
                but here I am assuming that every `Kₚ` has an associated `Kₛ` and I consider this pair
                to be 'a user'.
